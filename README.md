# BitWise-Status-Manager
This C project demonstrates the use of bitwise operations to efficiently manage and manipulate status flags. It includes functionality to set, clear, toggle, and check the state of individual bits within a status register. This allows for compact and fast control over multiple status indicators in a single integer value.

Features
- Set and clear specific status flags using bitwise operations.
- Toggle individual bits to quickly change status.
- Efficiently check the state of multiple flags.
- Provides a simple interface for managing flag-based states in embedded systems or resource-constrained applications.

This C program was made with th challenge of implementing all it's features using only the varibales and data types that were already defined at the top of the file!
